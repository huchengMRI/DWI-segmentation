The code is for generating a pseudo T1-weighted image from DWI images, see more details in this paper: 

Cheng H, Newman S, Afzali M, Fadnavis SS, Garyfallidis E. Segmentation of the brain using direction-averaged signal of DWI images. Magn Reson Imaging. 2020 Jun;69:1-7. doi: 10.1016/j.mri.2020.02.010. Epub 2020 Feb 20. PMID: 32088291.

To use this file, you need to download the NIFTI toolbox from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image. As matlab has a nifti reader now, I may change the script later.
